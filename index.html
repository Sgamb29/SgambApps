            computer science course CS50 on <a href="https://www.edx.org/">Edx.org</a>. Mostly develop sites and apps that I intend to use and find useful in my own life."

                <h3 class="itemTitle">Stretch Hold Timers</h3>
                <p class="description">This site is just a collection of timers. The countdown of seconds doesn't show on the site so you feel the time rather than watch the seconds.
                    Drums or Chimes sound when the timer is up and the screen changes color. Note: Currently the audio on the website doesn't work on apple smartphones. There's also
                    a sequence page with automatic timing and pictures showing the stretches for a simple routine.

                <p class="description">This site is for typing practice and just the enjoyment of typing. Just generates random letters, numbers and optionally special characters to type.
                    Tracks how long it takes you to type 1000 characters and how accurate you are, and then generates another 1000 characters when you reach the end.

                <p class="description">After switching to vaping from smoking this site was useful for not chain vaping or taking too many inhales in a short space of time (to avoid burnt vape taste). Basically just
                    a simple timer that you can adjust and even make it loop. Again, the audio doesn't work currently on apple smartphones.
